Type kubectl in the terminal to see its usage. The common format of a kubectl command is: kubectl action resource. This performs the specified action (like create, describe) on the specified resource (like node, container). You can use --help after the command to get additional info about possible parameters
Example: kubectl get nodes -- help

kubectl get nodes -- help

Check that kubectl is configured to talk to your cluster, by running the kubectl version command
kubectl version

To view the nodes in the cluster, run the kubectl get nodes command:
kubectl get nodes

Letâ€™s deploy our first app on Kubernetes with the kubectl create deployment command. We need to provide the deployment name and app image location (include the full repository url for images hosted outside Docker hub).
kubectl create deployment kubernetes-bootcamp --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1

To list your deployments use the get deployments command:
kubcetl get delpoyments
